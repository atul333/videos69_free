# Persistent Storage Implementation - Summary

## ✅ What Was Done

I've successfully implemented a **persistent storage system** for your Telegram bot that ensures all user data persists across bot restarts.

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before**: When the bot restarted, all user data was lost:
- ❌ Premium memberships were reset
- ❌ Video watch history was cleared
- ❌ Hourly video counts were reset

**After**: All user data is now saved to files:
- ✅ Premium memberships persist across restarts
- ✅ Video watch history is preserved
- ✅ Hourly video counts and limits are maintained
- ✅ All user progress is saved

## 📁 New Files Created

1. **`user_state_storage.py`** - New module that handles persistent storage
   - Loads/saves user states from/to JSON file
   - Handles datetime serialization
   - Provides cleanup and statistics functions
   - Uses caching for performance

2. **`user_states.json`** - New data file (auto-created)
   - Stores all user state data
   - Includes premium status, video history, hourly counts
   - Automatically updated when data changes

3. **`PERSISTENT_STORAGE.md`** - Documentation
   - Explains how the system works
   - Provides examples and troubleshooting
   - Details all features and benefits

4. **`test_persistent_storage.py`** - Test script
   - Verifies the storage system works correctly
   - Tests all major functions
   - ✅ All tests passed!

## 🔧 Modified Files

**`video69_bot.py`** - Updated to use persistent storage:
- Imports the new storage module
- Loads user states on startup
- Saves changes automatically after:
  - Watching a video
  - Granting premium access
  - Resetting hourly limits
  - Creating ad links
  - Clearing tokens
- Displays statistics on startup
- Cleans up expired data

## 📊 What Gets Saved

For each user, the following data is now persistent:

```json
{
  "user_id": {
    "seen_videos": [1, 5, 12, 45, 67],           // Videos watched
    "hourly_count": 3,                            // Videos this hour
    "last_reset": "2025-12-10T04:00:00+00:00",   // Last hourly reset
    "premium_until": "2025-12-10T16:30:00+00:00", // Premium expiry
    "ad_link": "https://arolinks.com/xyz",           // Ad link
    "ad_token": "123456789_1733812345_abc123"    // Verification token
  }
}
```

## 🎬 Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Premium User Restart
1. User watches an ad → Gets 12 hours premium
2. **Bot restarts** after 2 hours
3. ✅ User still has 10 hours premium remaining
4. ✅ Can continue watching unlimited videos

### Scenario 2: Free User Restart
1. User watches 7 videos this hour
2. **Bot restarts**
3. ✅ User still has 3 videos remaining
4. ✅ Limit resets at next hour mark

### Scenario 3: Video History
1. User watches 50 videos over time
2. **Bot restarts**
3. ✅ Won't see those 50 videos again
4. ✅ Only gets new, unseen videos

## 🚀 On Bot Startup

When you start the bot, you'll see:

```

## 📝 How to Use

**No changes needed!** The bot automatically:
1. Loads user states on startup
2. Saves changes when they happen
3. Cleans up expired data
4. Shows statistics

## 🧪 Testing
